This code creates a simple, interactive webpage for a yoga studio featuring a fixed navigation menu with links to different sections (Home, About, Services, Contact) and a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. The CSS styles provide a visually appealing layout with a gradient background and dynamic color changes for the navbar when the user scrolls. JavaScript enhances interactivity by adding a class to the navbar based on the scroll position, changing its appearance for improved usability. Overall, it effectively combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a user-friendly experience.
